# Coverage:
#   repo known     → writes <owner>-<repo>-<PR>.json with the repo field
#   migration      → supersedes a legacy <PR>.json that belongs to this repo
#   collision-safe → does NOT delete a legacy <PR>.json from ANOTHER repo
#   repo-less      → legacy <PR>.json (backward compat, no repo field)
