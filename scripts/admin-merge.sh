# admin-merge.sh — the MANDATED safe `--admin` merge (#930).
#
# `gh pr merge --admin` bypasses required checks, so nothing makes it *safe*: it
# cannot tell a check that is already red on main from a NEW failure the PR
# introduces. tortoise #3420 merged at 08:15 carrying
# `tests/test_markers.py::test_no_redirect_stems_registry_exact` — a test NOT in
# main's failing set — and main ratcheted redder.
#
# This script is the chokepoint. It computes the evidence, refuses to merge on a
# genuine new failure, and only then runs `gh pr merge --admin`. The matching
# merge gate (extensions/review-enforcer/) refuses a RAW `gh pr merge … --admin`
# that carries no head-bound evidence comment — so the bypass is safe or it does
# not happen.
#
#   pr-fails.txt   ← scripts/ci-failure-set.sh --commit <head>   # the head SHA,
#                    the exact revision the evidence marker binds to
#   main-fails.txt ← scripts/ci-failure-set.sh --main-union N
#   unique         ← scripts/ci-failure-set.sh --diff pr-fails.txt main-fails.txt
#   unique EMPTY            → post head-bound evidence, then merge
#   unique NON-EMPTY        → re-run the PR's failed jobs ONCE; anything that
#                             passes on retry is flaky, not new (recorded in the
#                             evidence). Residual unique still non-empty →
#                             BLOCK, print the list, exit non-zero, NO merge.
#
# TWO PRECONDITIONS THE FAILING SETS ALONE CANNOT EXPRESS:
#   1. THE HEAD MUST HAVE BEEN TESTED. The lane must have at least one TESTED run
#      for this head (a run that finished `success`, `failure` or `timed_out`) and
#      none still running. A queued run — or a run that finished `cancelled`,
#      `skipped` or `startup_failure`, none of which exercises the code — yields an
#      EMPTY failing set, indistinguishable from "green". Without this gate the
#      rail certifies nothing and merges before CI finishes, and the fresh
#      failure lands after the merge. That is the #3420 ratchet this rail exists
#      to stop (review P0 #3; `tested` rather than `completed`: review P1, cycle 2).
#   2. THE HEAD MUST NOT MOVE. The marker binds ONE SHA. The head is re-resolved
#      immediately before the comment and again by GitHub via
#      `--match-head-commit`, so a rebase inside the window cannot land an
#      unanalyzed head behind SHA-bound evidence (review P1).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/admin-merge.sh <PR> [--main-runs N] [--repo owner/repo]
#                              [--workflow <file|name>] [--any-workflow]
#                              [--no-rerun] [--rerun-timeout S] [--dry-run]
#                              [-- <extra gh pr merge flags>]
#
#   --main-runs N        union over main's last N runs (default 10 — see the
#                        #3469 trap in ci-failure-set.sh; a single run is not a
#                        baseline)
#   --workflow <f>       the TEST lane both sides are read from (default
#                        `python-ci.yml`). NOT cosmetic: an unfiltered main
#                        window is dominated by cron/watchdog lanes and can
#                        contain ZERO test runs, so the baseline extracts EMPTY
#                        and every PR failure reads as new — the bogus zero. See
#                        THE BOGUS ZERO in ci-failure-set.sh.
#   --any-workflow       drop the lane filter (opt-out; re-opens the bogus zero)
#   --no-rerun           skip the flake re-run classification (a non-empty
#                        unique set then blocks immediately)
#   --dry-run            compute + print the decision; mutates nothing at all —
#                        no CI re-run, no comment, no merge. On the flake path it
#                        reports and exits 0 (it is an inspection, not a verdict;
#                        a real run would re-run and re-classify). Add --no-rerun
#                        to get the no-reclassification verdict as the exit code.
#   --repo owner/repo    repo for the gh calls
#   Extra flags (`--squash`, `--merge`, `--rebase`, `--delete-branch`, `--auto`,
#   …) are passed through to `gh pr merge` rather than hardcoded. `--admin` is
#   always added by this script; a caller-supplied `--admin` is dropped.
#
# Env seams (tests only):
#   ADMIN_MERGE_GH              the gh command (default: `gh`)
#   ADMIN_MERGE_FAILURE_SET_SH  the parser to use (default: ./ci-failure-set.sh)

# build_evidence — the machine-readable comment. The marker binds the evidence
# to ONE head SHA: every push invalidates it, and the merge gate matches on it.
# ── EVIDENCE TAIL: one bound, one note, no fences ───────────────────────────
# The shape here is deliberately minimal, and the reasons are load-bearing:
#
#  * A LIST, not a fenced code block. A fence is a parser with state: a node id
#    containing a backtick run closes it early and swallows the rest of the
#    comment. A list has no such surface — so the fence-length computation, the
#    clip disclosure and the fence-balance test all cease to exist rather than
#    needing to be right.
#  * ONE limit for every embedded list, sized from the OBSERVED distribution:
#    main's union baseline runs ~18-19 entries of ~60 chars, and the default
#    window is 10 runs. So in practice the limit never fires — it is a safety
#    branch, not machinery that engages on every merge. 25 x 300 = 7,500 chars
#    per list; four lists is 30,000, comfortably under GitHub's 65,536-char body
#    cap, with no per-case arithmetic to re-derive.
#  * ONE note, on every list that was trimmed. A capped list that LOOKS complete
#    is worse than no list, so trimming is always stated.
#  * The display policy is stated ONCE in the body, not recomputed per list —
#    which is why there is no second note vocabulary.
#
# Bounds here are sized to what has actually been observed, not to a hypothetical
# worst case. Over-sizing them was how this section accumulated four interacting
# rules and a fence algorithm in the first place.
