"""Proof that pr-doctor's dispatch cap is the MACHINE's, never a private literal.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `scripts/pr-doctor.py` hardcoded `MAX_INFLIGHT = 4` "fleet-wide" while the
box that runs it is configured for `MAX_FIX=16` / `MAX_REVIEW=12`. The PR chain -- the path that
drains the backlog -- was therefore throttled to 4, and because the launch job passes no `--max`
there was no way to override it from config. Measured 2026-10-16: the same queue dispatched 0 at
the hardcoded cap and `prd-8797 -> OK` at `--max 12`, in the same minute on the same fleet.

The rule these tests pin:
  * a threshold configured on the machine reaches the dispatch cap (per class), and
  * the fallback defaults are the SAME model `orch-loop.sh` resolves, and
  * a dispatch that failed to read the lanes prints a named blindness, never a silent zero.
