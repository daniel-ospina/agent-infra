#!/usr/bin/env bash
# pr-doctor-fetch-refspec.test.sh — the materialisation gate: an ORDER that names
# `origin/<branch>` must have that ref to check out, on ANY clone shape.
#
# WHY THIS TEST EXISTS (measured 2026-10-30, agent-infra#3009). `pr-doctor.py` fetched a PR's branch
# with `git fetch origin <branch>` and then ran `git worktree add <path> -b <branch> origin/<branch>`.
# On the cell checkout `/tmp/cell-t3` — a SINGLE-BRANCH clone — the fetch SUCCEEDED (rc=0) and the
# ref it should have created was never created, so every order died as
#
#     worktree add failed rc=128: fatal: invalid reference: origin/fix/ci-runner-label-contract
#
# reported to the operator as `N order(s) no worker accepted` — which reads as a transport failure
# and was retried on every pass for weeks (`27 order(s) no worker accepted -> VERDICT=UNDELIVERED`).
# rung 2 of the cascade had never delivered a single order.
#
# ⛔ THIS TEST MUST FAIL WHEN THE ACTUATOR IS DISARMED. The actuator is ONE string: the refspec the
# fetch is given. The mutant is `_fetch_refspec(name) -> name` (the pre-fix behaviour). Section M
# runs that mutant against the SAME single-branch fixture and REQUIRES it to produce the failure —
# a test that passes under the mutant does not test anything.
