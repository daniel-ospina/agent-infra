  # Python >= 3.12 guard (#5128), which prints an explanation and NO `VERDICT` line. Absorbing that
  # into the `*)` arm below left the backlog empty and the script exiting 0, so no `.refresh-blocked`
  # marker was written and nothing appeared in `status`: the cell stayed RUNNING with `lanes: 0` —
  # the exact merge-only defect this gate exists to catch, now certified by it (#1748 review). The
  # exit code is read IMMEDIATELY after the command, with no `$(...)` in between (the retired
  # do-merge.sh bug class). EXIT_INCOMPLETE (2) and the verdict-less open-PR / ambiguous-target
  # refusals are per-issue and transient by nature; 3 is the tool's usage/environment code.

# Dedupe WITHOUT re-sorting. orch-loop.sh consumes this file top-down and dispatches the first
# BATCH entries, so its ORDER IS the dispatch priority. `sort -n -u` re-ordered the ENTIRE backlog
# by issue number, which is what put 238 P2s ahead of 20 P0s (#8465) — the same defect as the pool
# sort above, and it reappeared here on every cycle.
#
# This file is FIFO. The pool above is severity-ordered when it is appended, but an entry added on a
# LATER cycle joins at the BACK, behind whatever is already queued — so a P0 discovered while P2s sit
# at the head waits for them instead of displacing them. That residual is deliberate and bounded: the
# refresh only runs while the backlog is below 6 (orch-loop.sh) and BATCH is 2, so at most 5 entries
# can be ahead of it. The TIME that costs is contingent, not a ceiling: 5 entries at 2 per cycle is 3
# cycles only if the capacity gate is open each cycle — a load/lane/swap/memory gate that holds
# dispatch delays it further. The ENTRY bound is what the refresh guarantees; do not read a wall-clock
# ceiling into it. Carrying the tier through orch-loop.sh's reader would remove the residual at the
# cost of a second ordering surface; not worth it for a bounded handful of entries.
#
# `mv` is atomic within the directory (rename(2)), so a concurrent reader sees the old file or the new
# one, never a torn one; `&&` keeps a failed awk from truncating the live backlog. One deliberate
# trade: `mv` swaps the inode, so the target's mode is replaced by the temp's umask-derived one,
# whereas the old `sort -o` preserved it. The file holds only public issue numbers and its mode is
# never set deliberately, so 644 is not a property anything depends on.
