# ── release the cross-box ISSUE claim on the NO-CHAIN path (agent-infra#1850) ────────────────
# `orch-loop.sh` takes `refs/claims/issue-<N>` when it dispatches, and `chain-merge.sh` releases it
# from its EXIT trap — the NORMAL path. This is the path that never reaches that trap: the worktree
# could not be created, so no lane and no chain are spawned and NOTHING else will ever release the
# claim. Without this, a single failed `git worktree add` would hold a FREE issue across every box
# until the lease ran out (CLAIM_ISSUE_TTL, 3h) — and the reaper would meanwhile return the issue to
# the pool, where every box would read it as another box's live claim.
# The record/fence convention is claims.sh's `claim_issue_release_record` (one implementation; see
# its comment for why the handover file exists rather than the acquiring process doing the release).
