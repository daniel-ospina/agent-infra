# RAISE THE CLI DEADLINE. Measured 2026-10-01: `cmux workspace list` takes 0.2-2s on a
# quiet box but 13.4-15.1s at load 130+, against a fixed 15s CLI deadline — so a slow
# answer is indistinguishable from a hang (`Error: Command timed out`). That made the
# fleet look like "cmux send is dead" when it was a ~1.6s margin at high load.

# heartbeat-loop.sh — the heartbeat's real driver.
#
# ⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY THE PLIST IS NOT ENOUGH
# The cmux control socket REFUSES a launchd-spawned caller:
#     cmux send -> rc=1 :: Access denied - only processes started inside cmux can connect
# (`socketControlMode` = `cmuxOnly`; the app's other modes are `automation`,
# `password`, `off`.) The launchd job has been logging exactly that error on every
# tick since it was installed — it has NEVER delivered a single message. A
# heartbeat that fails this way is worse than no heartbeat, because the log reads
# as activity.
#
# MEASURED, and this is the fact the design rests on: a process that STARTED
# inside a cmux terminal still reaches the socket AFTER it is ORPHANED
# (`real_ppid=1`), and so do its own children — the gate is the launch-chain
# attribution macOS keeps for the tree, not a live parent chain. Verified with
# /tmp/detached-cmux-orphan.txt (3/3 trials OK at ppid=1) and
# /tmp/detached-documents-read.txt (the orphan still reads ~/Documents, so the
# loop may call tools/cmux_dispatch.py directly rather than reimplementing it).
#
# So: one detached loop, started ONCE from any cmux pane, replaces the timer.
# Nothing about it needs to be inside cmux interactively — it only has to have
# been started there, once.
#
# LIFECYCLE
#   start:  bash ~/.pi/agent/scripts/heartbeat-loop.sh        (idempotent)
#   stop:   touch ~/.pi/agent/state/HEARTBEAT-OFF             (loop exits)
#   pause:  touch ~/.pi/agent/state/HEARTBEAT-OFF, then start again to resume
#   status: cat ~/.pi/agent/state/heartbeat-loop.pid && kill -0 $(cat ...)
#
# ⛔ REBOOT: the loop does not survive one, and it CANNOT be restarted by launchd
# (that is the whole point above). Re-run the start command after a reboot, or set
# `automation.socketControlMode` in ~/.config/cmux/cmux.json so launchd may connect
# — that is an owner decision (it relaxes the socket from "only processes started
# inside cmux" to "any process by this user"), filed as an issue, not taken here.

  #    operational state must not live only there. Measured the day this was added: 10
  #    lanes sat DONE-IDLE with 46 work orders queued, and NOTHING was feeding them.
  #    The dispatcher reads lane->class from LANE-ASSIGNMENTS.tsv and the work itself from
  #    LANDABLE.tsv / REMEDY.tsv -- both durable files -- so any successor session, or this
  #    timer with no session at all, keeps the fleet fed.
  #    DONE-IDLE only, never a protected lane, one item per lane per 15-min cooldown, and
  #    the claim is taken before the send and RELEASED if the send does not land.
  #    Fail loud: an automatic dispatcher that dies quietly reports a green, exactly like
  #    the heartbeat bug above.
