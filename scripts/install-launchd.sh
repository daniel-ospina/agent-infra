# install-launchd.sh — idempotent installer for agent-infra launchd templates
# (agent-infra #304).
#
# Renders templates/launchd/*.plist with machine env, diffs the rendered
# output against the installed copy in ~/Library/LaunchAgents, and only
# reloads (enable → bootout → bootstrap) on change. Byte-identical → skip.
# Converges any machine to the canonical scheduled state; safe to run on
# every sync (this is the propagation trigger: a merged template bump applies
# on the next run).
#
# Placeholders substituted from env (with machine defaults):
#   {{HOME}}              $HOME (required)
#   {{PATH}}              the installer's PATH (launchd's default PATH lacks
#                         homebrew/bin — the alert jobs need `gh` on it), with the
#                         pi shim directory removed: launchd cannot exec into
#                         ~/.pi/agent/shims (symlinks into ~/Documents, TCC EPERM,
#                         #427/#1719)
#   {{AGENT_INFRA_PATH}}  this repo's MAIN checkout (env overrides; worktree-safe)
#   {{TORTOISE_REPO}}     env, else ~/Documents/GitHub/tortoise, else sibling ../tortoise
#   {{SWARM_ROOT}}        env only ("if present" — no auto-detect; canary is
#                         skipped on machines without one)
#   {{SWARM_ENV_FILE}}    env, else $HOME/.swarm.env
#   {{PYTHON_BIN}}        $SWARM_ROOT/.venv/bin/python, else `command -v python3`
#   {{PI_BIN_DIR}}        dirname of `command -v pi`, else /usr/local/bin
#
# A template that still contains an unresolved {{PLACEHOLDER}} is skipped with
# a loud warning (e.g. corruption-canary on a machine with no swarm root).
# A template whose script target does not resolve (broken symlink / missing
# file) is a HARD FAILURE — a dead job must never be installed.
#
# Usage:
#   install-launchd.sh               install/refresh all templates (idempotent)
#   install-launchd.sh --status      per-job: installed? loaded? version? drift?
#   install-launchd.sh --uninstall   bootout + remove installed plists
#   install-launchd.sh --help
#
# Env overrides (also used by install-launchd.test.sh):
#   TEMPLATES_DIR   template dir (default: this repo's templates/launchd)
#   AGENTS_DIR      install dir   (default: $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents)
#   ELDATO_ALLOW_TEST_HOME   permit launchd management when $HOME is not the
#                            real user home (tests ONLY — requires a launchctl
#                            shim on PATH so nothing reaches the real domain)
#
# Exit codes: 0 = ok (or clean skip), 1 = failure (loud), 2 = usage error.

# launchd_path — the PATH a rendered plist receives: {{PATH}} minus the pi SHIM directory.
#
# agent-infra#1719. `~/.pi/agent/shims` holds symlinks INTO ~/Documents (e.g.
# shims/gh -> <repo>/scripts/gh-shim/gh), a tree launchd cannot read: macOS TCC refuses the exec
# with EPERM (#427). It is FIRST on an interactive session's PATH — and sync.sh runs this installer
# FROM such a session — so every plist rendered from {{PATH}} began with a directory no launchd job
# can execute from, and a job's `gh` resolved to an unrunnable symlink. A scheduled job must never
# be handed a PATH element launchd cannot use, so the shim dir is dropped at render time; the real
# binaries later in PATH are what the jobs are meant to find.
#
# ⛔ RESOLVE THE PHYSICAL PATH, do not match the NAME (review E2). It is the shim's TARGET that
# launchd cannot read, so a PATH entry that is a SYMLINK to the shim directory matches no literal
# pattern and would be rendered verbatim into every job — re-creating the EPERM the helper exists
# to prevent. `scripts/orchestrator-harness/install.sh:add_dir()` resolves `pwd -P` for exactly
# this reason and warns against a name test; this mirrors it.
# ⛔ But only `*/shims`/`*/shims/*` are dropped, NOT all of `*/.pi/*`: `~/.pi/agent/bin` holds the
# REAL `fd`/`rg` binaries and is outside the TCC-protected tree, so install.sh's blanket `.pi`
# exclusion (harmless there — it adds resolved tool paths selectively) would cost these jobs
# tools they use. The LOGICAL path is kept so the version-independent pi symlink is not pinned.
# An entry that does not resolve is dropped too — launchd cannot resolve a tool from it.
