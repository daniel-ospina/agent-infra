# cloud-cell-supervisor.sh — run the orchestrator harness on a Linux cloud cell.
#
# The harness's macOS-specific parts are (a) how the CONTROLLER is started — install.sh
# renders a launchd plist — and (b) three OS primitives inside orch-loop.sh (stat -f, sysctl
# vm.loadavg, sysctl vm.swapusage) that are BSD-only. The lanes themselves were never
# launchd's: orch-loop.sh spawns them with `tmux new-session`, and tmux is on the devbox
# already. So a Linux cell needs this supervisor for (a), plus the portable-primitive fix
# tracked by agent-infra#1702 for (b). Until #1702 lands the cell controller aborts on its
# first cycle once a worker log exists, and the load/swap gates never bind — treat a cell as
# a MERGE ACTOR with incomplete back-pressure, not as a full peer of the laptop.
#
# Runs ON THE CELL (Linux). Usage:
#   bash cloud-cell-supervisor.sh start|stop|status|logs|check
#
# Prereqs on the cell (see cloud-cell-bringup.sh --check):
#   HOME writable · repo cloned · gh authenticated with push · provider key valid
#   + the merge authority key (AI_REVIEW_GATE_KEY) if this cell is to MERGE.
#
# ⛔ MEASURED 2026-10-13 — A CELL WITHOUT THE MERGE KEY IS **NOT** MERGE-INERT.
# An earlier draft of this file claimed a keyless cell was a safe "producer cell"
# that "will refuse every merge". That is FALSE, and the first run disproved it:
# within ~25s the controller armed AUTO-MERGE on #8425 and #8420 (`gh pr merge --auto`),
# which does NOT go through the gate key. So removing the key does not confine a cell
# to producing — it can still cause merges. Treat every started cell as a MERGE ACTOR.
