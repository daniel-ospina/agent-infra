# GitHub API rate limits — detection & fallback runbook

Written after the 2026-08-10 issue audit (48 issue closes + heavy querying in one
session exhausted the GraphQL quota mid-flow). #143

## Two limits, different behavior

| Limit | Scope | Symptom |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary** | 5000 req/h (REST + GraphQL separate pools) | `rate limit exceeded`, `gh api rate_limit` shows `remaining: 0` |
| **Secondary** | abuse detection (burst writes) | `API rate limit already exceeded for user ID ...` even with remaining quota — common after bulk issue closes/creates |

## Detect

```bash
gh api rate_limit --jq '.resources | {core: .core, graphql: .graphql}'
```

- `graphql.remaining: 0` → GraphQL pool exhausted; REST (`core`) is usually still fine.
- Secondary limits: transient (typically 1–5 min); sleeping does not always clear them
  for writes — switch transport instead.

## Fallback: REST for the operations gh uses GraphQL for

`gh pr create/view/merge` and `gh issue list` use GraphQL. REST equivalents:

```bash
# Create PR
gh api -X POST repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls --input - <<< '{"title":"...","head":"branch","base":"main","body":"..."}'

# Merge PR (squash)
gh api -X PUT repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}/merge --input - <<< '{"merge_method":"squash","sha":"<head_sha>"}'

# PR metadata (REST — includes mergeable)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n} --jq '{state,mergeable,head:.head.sha}'

# Issue comment
gh api -X POST repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{n}/comments --input - <<< '{"body":"..."}'

# Close issue (PATCH state)
gh api -X PATCH repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{n} --input - <<< '{"state":"closed"}'

# Head sha without GraphQL: git rev-parse HEAD
```

## Batching guidance

- Bulk closes/comments: insert a short sleep between calls (bulk closing 48 issues in
  one burst is what triggered the secondary limit).
- Prefer one REST call per fact over repeated `gh ... view` calls in loops.
- PR review records, merges, and issue closes are idempotent-safe: check current state
  before retrying after a rate-limit error.
